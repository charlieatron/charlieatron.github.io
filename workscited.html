			<li> Aboutkidshealth. "Hand/difference." YouTube. YouTube, 08 May 2014. Web. 23 Apr. 2016. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i690lLdBI-M>. This video is a fourteen minute documentary that covers the stories of a few different people that have hand deformities. It tries to convey the idea that many people are able to thrive in life despite what might appear to be a debilitating condition. I believe the video is credible because the production quality appears to be reasonably high, and as a self-proclaimed expert on this subject I have determined that many of the points they make are accurate. The reason I am choosing this video is so I can cite it in order to demonstrate how children with these anomalies can still lead great lives. One quote that stood out to me was this: "He plays, and he is still very active regardless of how his hand is slightly different from other people's."(Mother in reference to her toddler).</li><br>
			<li>Blauth, W., and F. Schneider-Sicker. Congenital Deformities of the Hand: An Atlas of Their Surgical Treatment. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1981. Google Books. Books, 6 Dec. 2012. Web. 23 Apr. 2016. <https://books.google.com/books?id=QqTwCAAAQBAJ>. This book is available in print, but I accessed it through Google Books. It is an interesting non-fiction book that talks about congenital hand deformities and different solutions for these problems, such as correctional surgery or prosthesis. I believe this book is credible because the two authors have worked together on multiple other medical works. One quote I took from the book was this: "In the past 10-15 years marked progress has been made in the surgical treatment of congenital anomalies of the hand. More and more, the reluctance to operate on these deformities has been abandoned".</li><br>
			<li>Callum, E. N. "Congenital Deformities of Hands and Feet." The British Medical Journal (1938): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 23 Apr. 2016. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20301350.pdf?_=1461429221324>. This journal talks about multiple different cases of people with congenital hand deformities. Considering its publishing date, it is likely one of the first scientific or analytical journals depicting this phenomenon. I believe this source is credible because the publisher, the British Medical Journal, appears to be reputable, even today. This source will help me derive some of the ideas I already have from a credible and reputable source. One interesting quote I found in this document is as follows: "He can grip quite strongly with his hands and perform all necessary actions".</li><br>
			<li>ChildrensHospital, and Amir Taghinia, MD. "About Congenital Hand Anomalies." YouTube. YouTube, 17 Feb. 2011. Web. 23 Apr. 2016. This video is a brief description of congenital hand deformities. In it, Amir Taghinia MD defines the condition and gives a general overview. This video is credible because it was uploaded by a Youtube channel owned by the Boston's Children Hospital. The channel is also verified by Youtube, meaning its content is popular and reputable. The source is useful for letting people know what congenital hand deformities are in a short, concise manner. One useful quote from the video is this: "There is a wide spectrum of the types of anomalies children can have in their hands".</li><br>
			<li>"Congenital Hand Differences." Congenital Hand Differences. Cleveland Clinic, n.d. Web. 23 Apr. 2016. <http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/orthopaedics-rheumatology/diseases-conditions/congenital-hand>. This is an medical article from the Cleveland Clinic that lists multiple conditions and types of hand deformities. It is very in-depth and describes the scientific attributes of each condition. I believe this source is credible because it is published by an official clinic and is very detailed. I plan to use this article to explain what hand deformities are and what forms they take. One interesting condition they described was syndactyly: "Syndactyly is a condition in which the fingers are fused together or the webbing between the fingers extends farther up the fingers than normal."</li><br>
